        description: "As the Intranet Intern at TD Wealth I gained extensive experience designing and building <span>accessible</span> internal webpages with <span>HTML and CSS</span>, as well as implementing custom <span>Vanilla Javascript</span> components and custom functionality when required. Webpages were designed based on data-driven best practices, tracking key metrics such as click-through rate and user retention time with <span>Adobe Analytics</span>. I also worked on automation projects using <span>Python</span>, in which I was able to develop a full-stack web application using the <span>Flask</span> framework to asynchronously make GET requests to check the response status of embedded links within internal webpages - resulting in upwards of <span>30 minutes saved per intranet page</span>. A key component of this role was ensuring that every site designed adhered to strict accessibility guidelines, and I aided in drafting the official web accessibility policy which is available on the <a href='https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/wealth' target='_blank'>TD Wealth Internet Site</a>. This project also included the development of an accessibility resource centre which I designed, researched, and built in a rushed timeframe, resulting in TD Wealth meeting legal accessibility guidelines ahead of the date set by legislation. I also gained experience with <span>agile project management</span> using <span>JIRA</span> as an issue tracking platform, and developed an understanding of mapping JSON data to JIRA tickets."

        date: 'January 2021 - May 2022',
        description: "As a student success assistant I had the opportunity to design and deliver a website for case competitions within the Haskayne School of Business. To achieve this I met with various stakeholder groups impacted such as coaches, the associate dean, professors, and student clubs to understand their needs and wants. From this information I developed a site mockup in <span>Figma</span> and provided the necessary information to the marketing team - ultimately resulting in a <a href='https://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/case-competitions' target='_blank'>currently-live site</a> that will go on to support hundreds of Commerce students. Similarly, I redesigned the process for applying to case competitions, and aided in designing the internal database used to manage applicants and competitions. I also rebuilt the post-graduate survey, implementing custom <span>RegEx validations</span> - resulting in hours saved on data cleaning and analysis time."
