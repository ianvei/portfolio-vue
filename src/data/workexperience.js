        description: 'As the Intranet Intern at TD Wealth I gained extensive experience designing and building accessible internal webpages with HTML and CSS, as well as implementing custom Vanilla Javascript components and custom functionality when required. Webpages were designed based on data-driven best practices, tracking key metrics such as click-through rate and user retention time with Adobe Analytics. I also worked on automation projects using Python, in which I was able to develop a full-stack web application using the Flask framework to asynchronously make GET requests to check the response status of embedded links within internal webpages - resulting in upwards of 30 minutes saved per intranet page. A key component of this role was ensuring that every site designed adhered to strict accessibility guidelines, and I aided in drafting the official web accessibility policy which is available on the <a>TD Wealth Internet Site</a>. This project also included the development of an accessibility resource centre which I designed, researched, and built in a rushed timeframe, resulting in TD Wealth meeting legal accessibility guidelines ahead of the date set by legislation. I also gained experience with agile project management using JIRA as an issue tracking platform, and developed an understanding of mapping JSON data to JIRA tickets.'

        date: 'January 2021 - May 2022',
        description: 'As a student success assistant I had the opportunity to design and deliver a website for case competitions within the Haskayne School of Business. To achieve this I met with various stakeholder groups impacted such as coaches, the associate dean, professors, and student clubs to understand their needs and wants. From this information I developed a site mockup in Figma and provided the necessary information to the marketing team - ultimately resulting in a currently-live site that will go on to support hundreds of Commerce students. Similarly, I redesigned the process for applying to case competitions, and aided in designing the internal database used to manage applicants and competitions. I also rebuilt the post-graduate survey, implementing custom RegEx validations - resulting in hours saved on data cleaning and analysis time.'
